Hello.

Most likely you're reading this after I've had this blog up for some time (or you're related to me).

So let me share a little about what I'm thinking while starting out. Right now, this is just a fuzzy little vision in my head, and don't know where this adventure will really go.

My basic goal is to share my ideas in hopes others find them useful, and others add their unique perspectives and share their ideas with even more people.

I think I can contribute when it comes to the future of technology, how to build it, and what it might look like. This is where my mind goes when I daydream and it's how I spend my free time, usually by tinkering with cutting edge software. I run into little useful ideas and, when experimenting, often have to work though many practical hurdles.

I also like the idea of sharing other parts of my life. I think it's good to have a place where we can think out loud, and where we can take risks and not worry about messing up. So I want to share some of the random and unusual things that I experience.

In the end, I want this to be a reflection of me. This blog is not meant to be a polished professional site. I want to share random thoughts about random things and add the the collective conversation happening online.

To that end, I also want to post regularly, but not necessarily frequently - I want everything to come naturally without forcing myself to write anything on a schedule.

Hope it's a good ride!
